# call it from your script using command line

# Command line

You can run PlantUML using the command line. (See [running](https://plantuml.com/en/command-linerunning) for ways to run PlantUML from various other tools and workflows).

The most basic way to run it is:

```
java -jar plantuml.jar file1 file2 file3
```

This will look for `@startXYZ` into `file1`, `file2` and `file3`. For each diagram, a `.png` file will be created.

For processing a whole directory, you can use:

```
java -jar plantuml.jar "c:/directory1" "c:/directory2"
```

This command will search for `@startXYZ` and `@endXYZ` into `.txt`, `.tex`, `.java`, `.htm`, `.html`, `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`, `.apt`, `.pu`, `.puml`, `.hpp`, `.hh` or `.md` files of the `c:/directory1` and `c:/directory2` directories.

Docker images are released as [Github Packages](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/pkgs/container/plantuml) and to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/plantuml/plantuml).

```
docker run ghcr.io/plantuml/plantuml
```
